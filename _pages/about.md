I am an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) in Statistics at [ENSAI](https://ensai.fr/), part of the [CREST](https://crest.science/) team.

Before that, I was a postdoctoral student in the [IdePHICS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/idephics/) lab at EPFL, under the supervision of [Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com/), working in statistical physics approaches to Machine Learning theory. I was a PhD student at Inria, part of the [DYOGENE](https://www.di.ens.fr/dyogene/) team, supervised by [Laurent Massouli√©](https://www.di.ens.fr/laurent.massoulie/). My thesis focused on inference problems in sparse random graphs, specifically those where the expected adjacency matrix posesses a low-rank structure. You can find my manuscript [here](https://hal.inria.fr/tel-03720004v1).

My research interests involve the rigorous study of statistical-physics inspired methods, from belief propagation to replica equations, to both statistical inference and Machine Learning. Check out my [publications](/publications) to know more!
